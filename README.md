INTRODUCTION:
This is the start of working through The Odin Project.  There seem to be various projects which I guess could be used for a portfolio of sorts.  I hope to learn full stack development.

I have previously used github and the command line before, but don't really remember much from first year uni.


TASK:
The task for this project is to create a very basic web-page of recipes.  I believe it will look quite ugly, but it will hone in skills.

Hopefully, my commit messages will be easy to parse and follow!

I will leave a reflection space below for any key learnings.
